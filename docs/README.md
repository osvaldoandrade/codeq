# codeQ Specification

This specification defines codeQ, a reactive scheduling and completion system built on persistent queues in KVRocks. The design is inspired by Dyno Queues and its use of Dynomite as a lightweight DynamoDB-like storage layer, but codeQ targets KVRocks and is implemented in Go.
