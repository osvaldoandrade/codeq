## Review Comment 1: skip-if-match Placement

**Comment**: The skip-if-match condition is placed under workflow_dispatch, which may cause it to only apply to manual triggers. Verify that this placement works as intended for both push and workflow_dispatch triggers.

**Response**: ✅ **Verified Correct**

The placement is correct. The `skip-if-match` is a gh-aw-specific directive that is processed at compile time, not a standard GitHub Actions feature. When compiled:

1. The directive becomes a search check in the `pre_activation` job
2. It runs before any actual workflow logic
3. The compiled workflow shows:
   ```yaml
   # skip-if-match: is:pr is:open in:title "[update-docs]" 
   # Skip-if-match processed as search check in pre-activation job
   ```

4. The pre_activation job's `activated` output includes the check:
   ```yaml
   activated: ${{ (steps.check_membership.outputs.is_team_member == 'true') 
                && (steps.check_skip_if_match.outputs.skip_check_ok == 'true') }}
   ```

5. The check searches GitHub for: `is:pr is:open in:title "[update-docs]"`
6. If any matching PRs are found, the workflow is skipped

This works for both `push` and `workflow_dispatch` triggers.

## Review Comment 2: agentics-maintenance.yml Version Tag

**Comment**: This action reference uses a version tag (@v0.45.0) without a SHA pin, while other workflow files use SHA-pinned references. For consistency and security, consider using the SHA-pinned format.

**Response**: ℹ️ **Auto-Generated File**

The `agentics-maintenance.yml` file is auto-generated by gh-aw v0.45.0 (line 16):

```yaml
# This file was automatically generated by pkg/workflow/maintenance_workflow.go (v0.45.0). DO NOT EDIT.
```

The file header explicitly states "DO NOT EDIT" and provides regeneration instructions:
- Run `gh aw compile`
- Or use `make recompile`

**Recommendation**: This should be reported to the gh-aw project as a potential improvement in their code generator. The generator should use SHA-pinned references consistently, like it does for other actions in the same workflow (e.g., `actions/github-script@ed597411d8f924073f98dfc5c65a23a2325f34cd # v8`).

For this PR, we should not manually edit the auto-generated file, as it would be overwritten on the next compilation.

## Summary

Both review comments have been addressed:
1. ✅ skip-if-match placement is verified correct
2. ℹ️ agentics-maintenance.yml is an auto-generated file with an upstream improvement opportunity

The PR changes are working as intended.
